### Last Friday Afternoon of Sprint

### Timebox: 
1.5 Hours

### Artifacts: 
1. Retro Report
2. Management Report of questions/concerns *(If Needed)*
3. Process improvement for next sprint planning
4. Action Items to be followed up on

### Description:
This is the team’s time to come together without worrying about management's presence to discuss:
- What went well & why
- What didn’t go well & well
- What in our process needs improved
*Note:* It is important to leave ego at the door. As a team you cannot grow if you can’t honestly discuss improvements and hold each other accountable. At the end of the sprint if ALL work was NOT completed it is the failure of the team as a whole, not just a team member(s). 

### Agenda:
1. Facilitator introduces themselves, welcomes everyone to the meeting & Reads the RULES OF RETRO
- - RULES OF RETRO: Don't make it personal, don't take it personally. Always listen with an open mind, and remember that everyone's experience is valid (even experiences you may not have had). Remember we are all on the same team, working towards the same goal. Don't be afraid to talk about the process and where it failed in the last sprint (or decided upon boundary i.e. product failure, sprint, release, etc.).

2. Team adds their stuff to the board as they enter (if remote - before the meeting starts) with their initials.

3. Scrum Master or Scribe volunteers to take retro notes and capture action items.

4. Discussion commences

5. Notes get quickly re-capped with the team, process improvement for the next sprint determined and items for management identified. 

6. Meeting Ends

7. Retro Report & Management Report Generated

8. Sprint is Ended
